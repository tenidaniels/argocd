Deploy Argo CD to Kubernetes
Use the terminal to deploy Argo CD:


copy
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codefresh-contrib/gitops-certification-examples/main/argocd-noauth/install.yaml
This will create a new namespace, argocd, where Argo CD services and application resources will live.

To view the deployment enter


copy
kubectl get pods -n argocd
Note that this is simple installation method without any authentication. In a real setting you would probably setup SSO with your ArgoCD instance.
